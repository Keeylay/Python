I want you to know that i want to deal with you in a capacity that nobody else 
gets to deal with you. I want you to know that I give a shit about you, about us, about 
everything that comes with. I want you to know that I have the capacity to hold psace for you as long
as you hold space for me too. I want you to know that I wont shut you out on your dark days
and I will never again make you feel like shit when you make a mistake. I want you to know I want
to be your escape.
